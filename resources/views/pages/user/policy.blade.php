        <p>We strive to offer the best service possible – to offer commuters and drivers the opportunity to earn extra income by wrapping their
            vehicle in eye-catching art and commercial messaging. For purposes of this Privacy Policy (“Policy” or “Privacy Policy”), the terms “we,”
            “us,” “our” and “Flare” refer to Flare Co.,Ltd. and “you” and “your” refers to you, as a user of the Flare service. The Privacy Policy
            below governs your Flare account and any information you provide on this site.</p>

            mobile applications, however accessed and/or used, whether via personal computers, mobile devices or otherwise) and “offline” (e.g.,
            collection of data through mailings, telephone, or in person) activities owned, operated, provided, or made available by Flare. Our
            “online” and “offline” activities are collectively referenced as the “Services.” This Privacy Policy also applies to your use of
            interactive features or downloads that:</p>

            <li>we own or control.</li>
            <li>are available through the Services; or</li>

            any of our Services or give us any of your information. In addition, please review our Terms and Conditions, which may apply to your use
            of our websites and mobile applications. This Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference into the applicable Terms and Conditions.</p>
        <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at info@flare.run.</p>
        <p>What information do we collect?</p>
        <p>In order to operate the Flare service and to provide our Services, including, but not limited to, matching commuters and drivers with
            advertisers, we must ask you to provide nonpublic personal information about yourself, such as your name, e-mail address and mobile number
            (“Personal Information”). We may collect this information through various forms and in various places through the Services, including
            account registration forms, “contact us forms”, or when you otherwise interact with us. When you sign up to use the Services, you create a
            user profile. The current required data fields are:</p>
        <p>Name</p>
        <p>Address</p>
        <p>Email</p>
        <p>Phone Number</p>
        <p>Social Security (Background Check)</p>
        <p>Driver License (Motor Vehicle Record)</p>
        <p>Vehicle VIN Number</p>
        <br>
        <p>In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to us, we and our third-party service providers may
            use a variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the
            Services (“Usage Information”). This Usage Information may include the browser that you are using, the URL that referred you to our
            Services, all of the areas within our Services that you visit, and the time of day, among other information. We may use Usage Information
            for a variety of purposes, including to enhance or otherwise improve the Services. In addition, we collect your IP address or other unique
            identifier (” Device Identifier”) for your computer, mobile or other device used to access the Services (any, a “Device”). A Device
            Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access the Services, and our computers identify your Device
            by its Device Identifier. Usage Information may be non-identifying or may be associated with you. Whenever we associate Usage Information
            or a Device Identifier with your Personal Information, we will treat it as Personal Information.</p>
        <p>In addition, tracking information is collected as you navigate through our Services, including, but not limited to geographic areas. For
            all drivers using our Services, the driver’s mobile phone will send your GPS coordinates, during the commute, to our servers. Most GPS
            enabled mobile devices can define one’s location to within (20) meter. We collect this information for various purposes – including to
            determine the amount of money you earn while performing the Services, to provide you with support, to send you promotions and offers, to
            enhance our Services, and for our internal business purposes. We may also have features that allow you to share this information with
            other people (such as your family, friends or colleagues) if you choose.</p>
        <p>In addition, our advertisers can see the GPS coordinates recorded by the driver’s mobile phone for all driving time, as well as certain
            information about you (such as your name and other Personal Information).</p>
        <p>A few of the methods that may be used to collect Usage Information include, without limitation, the following (and subsequent technology
            and methods hereafter developed):</p>

            commercially reasonable security practices such as encryption, firewalls and SSL (Secure Socket Layers) for protecting your information

            the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won’t be intercepted while being transmitted to us over
            the Internet or wireless communication, and any information you transmit to the Company you do at your own risk. We recommend that you not

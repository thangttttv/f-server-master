        <br>
        "6.2 The Advertiser authorises Flare to invoice the Agent on the Advertiser’s behalf and such invoice shall constitute due notice to the
        Advertiser and shall in no way impair or limit the joint and several liability of the Advertiser and the Agent.
        Payment by the Advertiser to the Agent shall not discharge the Advertiser’s liability to Flare."<br>
        <br>
        6.3 The Advertiser and the Agent shall be jointly and severally liable for all Taxes. If the Advertiser or Agent is required under law to
        deduct or withhold any sum as Taxes on any amount payable to Flare, the amount payable to Flare shall be increased by such amount necessary to

        withholding.<br>
        <br>
        6.4 Time is of the essence in the payment of all Charges and Taxes. Flare’s obligations to provide Services under this Agreement will not

        usage exceeds or may exceed a preset limit. However, Flare may send to the Advertiser bills at such intervals as it deems appropriate. All
        Charges are due as soon as the bill is issued. Each bill must be settled by the payment date set out in it. Unless otherwise stated in the
        bill or elsewhere, all Charges are payable in Thailand dollars.<br>
        In the absence of fraud or manifest error, subject to Clause 6.8 below, Flare may rely on each bill as conclusive evidence against the the
        Advertiser/Agent of the accuracy, completeness and truth of all matters stated in it."<br>
        <br>
        "6.8 If the Advertiser wishes to reasonably dispute any amount in the bill, the Advertiser can withhold payment for such disputed amounts if
        the Advertiser informs Flare in writing prior to the payment date shown on the bill. Otherwise, the Advertiser shall be liable to pay all
        Charges. Flare will investigate any such dispute and provide a written response to the Advertiser within fourteen (14) days from the day the
        Advertiser notifies Flare of such a dispute. If the dispute is resolved in Flare’s favour, the Advertiser shall pay Flare the disputed amount
        and all costs incurred in recovering<br>
        the amount. Flare may charge the Advertiser interest on the outstanding amount at 10% per month from the date the outstanding amount was due
        and payable and calculated on a daily basis or at such other rates as Flare may prescribe from time to time. Alternatively, Flare may charge
        the Advertiser the standard late payment fee as Flare may prescribe from time to time. If Flare agrees there is a mistake in the Advertiser’s
        bill, Flare will adjust the Advertiser’s next bill accordingly. If the Advertiser has paid a bill for a post-paid Service and subsequently
        choose to contest it, any such dispute must be raised by the Advertiser in writing to Flare not later than three (3) months from the date
        of that bill. If the Advertiser has paid for a bill for a pre-paid Service and subsequently chooses to contest it, any dispute must be
        raised by the Advertiser in writing to Flare not later than three (3) months from the date of the Advertiser’s payment."<br>
        <br>
        "6.9 If the Advertiser is late in paying or does not pay a bill for any Service, Flare may, at its discretion, suspend, restrict or terminate
        any of the Services that Flare provides to the Advertiser and charge the Advertiser administrative fees and/or late payment interest or fee as
        set out in Clause 6.12 below. In addition, Flare may, at its discretion, also require the Advertiser to pay on demand all sums due under any
        other agreements or accounts the Advertiser have with Flare.<br>
        If Flare claims against the Advertiser for failing to pay any bill, the Advertiser shall be liable for all Flare’s legal, administrative and
        other costs."<br>
        <br>
        "6.10 If the Advertiser uses more than one of Flare’s Services, the Advertiser shall specify which Service(s) under the Advertiser’s bill it
        is making payment for. In the event the Advertiser fails to identify the Service(s) for which payment has been made, any payment the
        Advertiser make may be applied or allocated by Flare towards any outstanding amount for any Service in such manner, priority, order and
        proportion as Flare deems appropriate.<br>
        If the Advertiser has more than one account with Flare, Flare may transfer any credit balance under one account to settle outstanding amounts
        due under another account."<br>
        <br>
        6.11 Flare may, at its discretion, authorise its Affiliates to issue bills and collect payment of Charges and moneys on its behalf.<br>
        <br>
        6.12 Flare reserves the right to charge the Advertiser and/or the Agent interest on any outstanding amount at the rate of 10% per month from
        the date such amount is due until payment is received in full.<br>
        <br>
        6.13 Flare may revise its rates for the Services from time to time. In such event, the Advertiser and Agent agree to be bound by such revised
        rates provided Flare gives at least fourteen (14) days prior notice of such change and the increased rates shall apply only to such Services
        procured by the Advertiser and Agent after the effective date of change.<br>
        <br>
        6.14 Flare reserves the right to pro-rate any charges which might include any Business expenses, production cost and labor cost should there
        be any early termination based on the ending date of campaign(s).<br>

        the Disclosing Party shall, without proof of special damage, be entitled to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief for
        any threatened or actual breach of the provisions of this Clause, in addition to any damages or other remedy to which it may be entitled.<br>
        <br>
        14.4 The obligations of the Parties contained in this Clause shall continue in force notwithstanding the expiry or termination of this
        Agreement for a period of two (3) years after such expiry or termination.<br>

        (a) if the other Party fails to observe and/or to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement and does not rectify the failure within
        fourteen (3) days of written notice by the non-defaulting Party (which shall include a delay or failure by the Advertiser to make payment
        under this Agreement);<br>
        (b) if the other Party becomes insolvent or bankrupt, or has a winding up petition filed against it which is not dismissed within thirty (30)
        days, or admits its inability to pay its debts as they mature, or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or has distress or
        execution proceedings levied on its properties or assets, or has a liquidator, receiver, judicial manager or special manager or anything
        analogous to the foregoing appointed over the undertaking or property of the other Party, or ceases to carry on business or makes any special
        arrangement or composition with its creditors; or (c) where a Force Majeure Event exceeds the Force Majeure Period.<br>
        <br>
        15.3 Expiry or termination of this Agreement shall be without prejudice to the rights, obligations and/or Liabilities of the Parties which may

        from the other Party for the purposes of this Agreement; and (b) deliver up to the other Party all Intellectual Property in the possession or

        Advertiser shall pay all amounts due and owing under this Agreement including the unutilized portion of the Total Contract Value up to the
        date of the expiry, all such amounts shall become immediately due and payable. The Advertiser acknowledges and accepts that the requirement
        for it to pay for unutilized portion of the Total Contract Value required under this Agreement is a genuine pre-estimate of the damages that
        is suffered by Flare as a result of
        such termination, and not a penalty. The termination of this Agreement will not affect any accrued rights or remedies of either party against
        the other party."<br>
        <br>
        16.2 The following provisions shall apply on and after notice of termination:<br>

        (c) any claim which either Party may have against the other in respect of any breach or non-performance or repudiation of any of the
        provisions of this Agreement which shall have occurred prior to such termination or suspension shall not be affected or prejudiced and all
        rights of suspension or termination under this Agreement are in addition to and separate from any other rights of each Party at law.<br>
        <br>
        17 NO PARTNERSHIP<br>
        This Agreement is not intended to, nor shall be deemed to constitute or operate to create a partnership or joint venture or contract of
        employment of any kind between the Parties or to authorise either Party to act as agent for the other, and neither Party shall have authority
        to act in the name or on behalf of or otherwise to bind the other in any way (including the making of any representation or warranty, the
        assumption of any obligation or liability and the exercise of any right or power).<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        18 RIGHT TO ASSIGN AND SUB-LICENCE<br>

        transfer and/or deal in any other manner with this Agreement or any of its rights under this Agreement and/or sub-contract any or all of its
        obligations under this Agreement or purport to do any of the same without the prior written consent of the other Party (such consent not to be
        unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed) provided that Flare shall be entitled to assign at law or in equity (including by way of a
        charge or declaration of trust), sub-license, transfer and/or deal in any other manner with this Agreement or any of its rights under this
        Agreement and/or sub- contract any or all of its obligations under this Agreement to any Affiliate without further notice to the Advertiser or

        18.2 Each Party shall execute such agreements or documents as the other Party may reasonably require, to give full effect to the assignments,
        agreements, sub-licences, transfers and/or sub-contracts referred to in this Agreement.<br>

        19 SERVICE LIMITATIONS<br>
        19.1 The Advertiser accepts that the average mileage of 500 kilometres travelled per month per vehicle quoted by Flare for advertisements
        placed on vehicles is an estimate and that the total mileage travelled by vehicles in the Advertiser’s campaign is subject to multiple events
        and conditions outside of Flare’s control and thus shall not hold Flare liable for any shortfall in campaign mileage travelled.<br>
        <br>
        "19.2 Facebook sharing by Flare’s Drivers and Advertising Partners shall be deemed as a bonus benefit to Advertisers. Flare shall endeavour to

        19.3 Flare does not warrant that advertisements placed on vehicles shall be in perfect condition at all times. Flare shall conduct random

        <br>
        19.4 In the event that Flare’s Driver or Advertising Partner’s vehicle becomes involved in an accident, Flare shall replace the advertisement
        sticker or change to another Driver or Advertising Partner at its own cost. If Flare becomes aware that the vehicle involved in the accident
        is in such a state that it has to be taken out of service, Flare shall arrange for the advertisement to be displayed by another Driver or
        Advertising Partner within 72 hours of such knowledge.<br>
        <br>
        19.5 The Advertiser accepts that quality and installation of advertisement stickers provided by Flare and its agents will be on a best effort
        basis. The quality of the advertisement stickers provided may have slight variations from the artwork provided or approved by the Advertiser
        and that the quality of installation can vary between different vehicles.<br>
        <br>
        19.6 As each vehicle in the same advertisement campaign may be of a different model and make, Flare reserves the right to modify the
        advertisement sticker design slightly in order to fit each vehicle.<br>
        <br>
        19.7 The Advertiser accept that the route taken by Flare’s Driver or Advertising Partner may differ from the stated route on occasion.<br>
        <br>

        request so as to commence service delivery as soon as possible.<br>
        <br>
        19.11Flare’s Drivers and Advertising Partners’ information are confidential and will not be made available to the Advertiser except for car
        plate, age and profession.<br>
        <br>
        20 FORCE MAJEURE<br>
        20.1 If the performance of this Agreement by either Party is prevented, hindered or delayed by reason of a Force Majeure Event then that Party
        shall be excused from such performance to the extent that it is necessarily prevented, hindered or delayed thereby during the continuance of
        any such cause or circumstance and this Agreement shall be suspended for so long as and to the extent that any such cause or circumstance
        prevents, hinders or delays performance of this Agreement.<br>
        <br>
        20.2 For the avoidance of doubt, neither lack of funds nor a default or misconduct by any personnel of the Advertiser or Agent or third party
